# PegProblem

This came about after having a discussion with my son, Holden, on how
to solve the peg board game that is popular at Cracker Barrel.

This project has one class that recursively runs down all of the paths
that a person could take given different starting positions.

There are 4 unique starting positions.  The tests are available to show
that everything executes properly.

To run, clone the repo and run `mvn clean install`.
